### 2.3. Potential Data Quality Issues

1.  **Garage_Size Zero Values:** The `Garage_Size` feature has 321 zero values. This could indicate houses without garages. It is important to verify if these zero values are accurate and represent a genuine absence of a garage, or if they are the result of data entry errors.
2.  **Lot_Size Minimum Value:** The minimum value for `Lot_Size` is 0.51. While not necessarily an error, extremely small lot sizes should be examined to ensure they are realistic and not the result of data entry errors.
3.  **High Correlation between Square Footage and House Price:** The very strong correlation (0.99) between `Square_Footage` and `House_Price` may suggest a potential issue of multicollinearity if this dataset were used in a more complex regression model with other features. It is likely valid in this context, but worth noting.

## 3. Anomaly Detection

### 3.1. Outlier Analysis
The anomaly detection tool did not identify any extreme outliers in the dataset.

## 4. Recommended Resolution Strategies

1.  **Garage_Size Zero Values:**
    *   **Verification:** Cross-reference the records with zero `Garage_Size` with external data sources (e.g., property records, satellite imagery) to confirm the absence of a garage.
    *   **Imputation (if necessary):** If the zero values are determined to be errors, consider imputing them based on the neighborhood average or other relevant factors. However, if the zero values are accurate, leave them as is.
2.  **Lot_Size Minimum Value:**
    *   **Verification:** Investigate the records with very small `Lot_Size` values to ensure their accuracy. Compare them to property records or satellite imagery.
    *   **Correction (if necessary):** If the small `Lot_Size` values are found to be errors, correct them using reliable data sources.
3.  **High Correlation between Square Footage and House Price:**
    *   **Monitoring:** While a high correlation is expected and not necessarily an error, monitor this relationship in future data updates. Drastic changes in this correlation could indicate underlying data quality issues or market shifts.

## 5. Step-by-Step Approach to Handling Anomalies

### 5.1. Data Profiling
1.  **Detailed Statistics:** Calculate descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, min, max, quartiles) for each feature to identify potential anomalies and unusual distributions.
2.  **Value Frequency:** Examine the frequency of unique values for categorical features to identify inconsistencies or unexpected categories.

### 5.2. Verification and Correction
1.  **Cross-Referencing:** Validate data against external sources (property records, public databases) to verify accuracy.
2.  **Data Correction:** Correct erroneous values based on reliable information. Document all corrections made.

### 5.3. Imputation (if necessary)
1.  **Missing Value Imputation:** If missing values are identified after the initial assessment (which is not the case here), use appropriate imputation techniques (mean, median, mode, regression-based imputation) based on the nature of the data and the extent of missingness.
2.  **Outlier Treatment:** Decide whether to remove, cap, or transform outliers based on their impact on the analysis.

### 5.4. Documentation
1.  **Record All Changes:** Maintain a detailed log of all data quality issues identified and the steps taken to resolve them.
2.  **Update Data Dictionary:** Update the data dictionary with any new insights or changes to the data.
