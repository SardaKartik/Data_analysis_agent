      "    *   Cross-validate with other features (e.g., location, house type) to see if there are patterns associated with zero garage size.\n",

      "\n",
      "*   **Description:** The anomaly detection process did not identify any outliers in the numerical features.\n",

      "1.  **Scatter Plot: Square_Footage vs. House_Price (C:\\Users\\karti\\Desktop\\Project\\Data_analyst_agent\\house_price_regression_dataset_scatter_plot.png)**\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **Description:** This scatter plot visualizes the relationship between the square footage of a house and its price. Each point on the plot represents a house, with its x-coordinate indicating the square footage and its y-coordinate indicating the house price.\n",
      "    *   **Insights:** The plot reveals a positive correlation between square footage and house price. As the square footage increases, the house price tends to increase as well. This suggests that square footage is a significant factor in determining house prices. There might be some outliers, representing houses with similar square footage but different prices, which could be influenced by other factors.\n",
      "    *   **Contribution:** This plot helps understand the basic relationship between house size and price, which is a fundamental aspect of real estate valuation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Box Plot: Num_Bedrooms vs. House_Price (C:\\Users\\karti\\Desktop\\Project\\Data_analyst_agent\\house_price_regression_dataset_boxplot_plot.png)**\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **Description:** This box plot shows the distribution of house prices for different numbers of bedrooms. Each box represents the interquartile range (IQR) of house prices for a specific number of bedrooms, with the median indicated by a line inside the box. The whiskers extend to show the range of the data, and outliers are plotted as individual points.\n",
      "    *   **Insights:** The plot provides insights into how the number of bedrooms affects the distribution of house prices. We can observe the median house price for each bedroom category and the spread of prices. It helps identify if houses with more bedrooms tend to have higher prices and if there's significant variability in prices within each bedroom category.\n",
      "    *   **Contribution:** This plot helps understand the impact of the number of bedrooms on house prices, considering the distribution and variability of prices within each category.\n",

      "\n",
      "    *   **Description:** This box plot illustrates the distribution of house prices across different neighborhood quality ratings. Each box represents the IQR of house prices for a particular neighborhood quality, with the median indicated inside the box.\n",
      "    *   **Insights:** The plot demonstrates the relationship between neighborhood quality and house prices. Generally, higher neighborhood quality ratings correspond to higher house prices. The spread of house prices within each neighborhood quality category can also be observed. This visualization helps assess the premium associated with better neighborhoods.\n",
      "    *   **Contribution:** This plot highlights the importance of location and neighborhood amenities in determining house prices, showing how perceived quality impacts market value.\n",

      "\n",
      "    *   **Description:** This histogram displays the distribution of the years in which the houses were built. The x-axis represents the year built, and the y-axis represents the frequency or count of houses built in each year or year range.\n",
      "    *   **Insights:** The histogram shows the age distribution of the houses in the dataset. We can observe the most common building periods and any trends in construction activity over time. This can be useful for understanding the housing stock's age and potential renovation needs.\n",
      "    *   **Contribution:** This plot provides context about the age of the properties in the dataset, which can influence their value and appeal to buyers.\n",

      "    *   **Description:** This heatmap visualizes the correlation matrix of the numerical features in the dataset. Each cell in the heatmap represents the correlation coefficient between two features, with the color intensity indicating the strength and direction of the correlation.\n",
      "    *   **Insights:** The heatmap reveals the relationships between different features. Positive correlations are indicated by warmer colors, while negative correlations are indicated by cooler colors. We can identify features that are strongly correlated with house prices, as well as features that are correlated with each other. For example, a strong positive correlation between square footage and house price would be indicated by a bright color.\n",
