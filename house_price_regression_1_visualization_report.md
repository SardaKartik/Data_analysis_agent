      "description": "This scatter plot visualizes the relationship between the square footage of a house and its price. Each point on the plot represents a house, with its x-coordinate indicating the square footage and its y-coordinate indicating the house price. A positive correlation would suggest that larger houses tend to have higher prices. The spread of the points can also indicate the variability in house prices for a given square footage.",
      "insights": "Reveals the general trend of how house price changes with square footage. A positive trend would indicate that, in general, larger houses cost more. Outliers can indicate potentially under/over valued houses.",
      "contribution": "Helps understand the impact of size on house pricing, a key factor in real estate valuation."

      "description": "This histogram shows the distribution of house prices in the dataset. The x-axis represents house prices, and the y-axis represents the frequency or count of houses within each price range (bin). The shape of the histogram reveals whether house prices are normally distributed, skewed, or have multiple peaks. This provides insights into the typical price range and the presence of any unusual price concentrations.",
      "insights": "Shows the distribution of house prices, indicating the most common price ranges and potential skewness in the data. This reveals whether the majority of houses are within a certain price range or if there are a significant number of very expensive or very cheap houses.",
      "contribution": "Provides an overview of the price range and frequency of houses in the dataset."

      "description": "This box plot visualizes the distribution of house prices for different numbers of bedrooms. Each box represents the interquartile range (IQR) of house prices for a specific number of bedrooms. The median is shown as a line within the box, and the whiskers extend to the data points within 1.5 times the IQR. Outliers are shown as individual points beyond the whiskers. This helps compare the central tendency, spread, and skewness of house prices across different bedroom categories.",
      "insights": "Compares the distribution of house prices for different numbers of bedrooms. It shows the median, quartiles, and outliers, helping to understand the typical price range and variability for houses with different numbers of bedrooms.",

Each point on the plot represents a house, with its x-coordinate indicating the year built and its y-coordinate indicating the house price. This helps identify any trends in house prices based on the age of the house. For instance, newer houses might generally command higher prices, or there might be price fluctuations related to specific historical periods.",
      "insights": "Reveals trends in house prices based on the year the house was built. It can show whether newer houses are generally more expensive or if there are price fluctuations related to specific periods.",
