## Anomaly Detection Analysis

### 1. PassengerId
- **Method:** Range check.
- **Anomalies:** No significant anomalies detected. The IDs are uniformly distributed.
- **Potential Issues:** None.
- **Recommendations:** No action needed.

### 2. Survived
- **Method:** Basic statistic review (mean and median).
- **Anomalies:** The mean survival rate is 38%, with the median at 0, indicating more non-survivors.
- **Potential Issues:** None. This is a binary outcome, so no data quality issues are apparent.
- **Recommendations:** No action needed.

### 3. Pclass
- **Method:** Basic statistic review (mean and median).
- **Anomalies:** The mean class is 2.31, with the median at 3, suggesting a higher proportion of passengers in lower classes.
- **Potential Issues:** None.
- **Recommendations:** No action needed.

### 4. Age
- **Method:** Range and IQR check.
- **Anomalies:**
    - **Extreme Values:** Minimum age is 0.42, and maximum is 80.00.
    - **Outliers (IQR):**  Values below Q1 - 1.5 * IQR and above Q3 + 1.5 * IQR. Given Q1 ≈ 20, Q3 ≈ 38, IQR ≈ 18, any value below 20 - 1.5 * 18 = -7 and above 38 + 1.5 * 18 = 65 are considered outliers. Therefore, values above 65 are considered outliers.
- **Potential Issues:** Data entry errors or genuinely old/young passengers.
- **Recommendations:** Verify ages above 65. Consider capping or trimming extreme ages if necessary for modeling. Impute missing values using appropriate methods (mean, median, or regression imputation).

### 5. SibSp
- **Method:** IQR check.
- **Anomalies:**
    - **Outliers (IQR):** Given the right-skewed distribution, outliers are likely on the higher end. With Q1 = 0, Q3 = 1, IQR = 1, outliers are above 1 + 1.5 * 1 = 2.5. Thus, SibSp values of 3, 4, 5, and 8 are outliers.
- **Potential Issues:** Passengers with unusually large families.
- **Recommendations:** Investigate passengers with SibSp > 2. Consider feature engineering to group smaller families together.

### 6. Parch
- **Method:** IQR check.
- **Anomalies:**
    - **Outliers (IQR):** Similar to SibSp, outliers are on the higher end. With Q1 = 0, Q3 = 0, IQR = 0, any value above 0 is an outlier. Thus, Parch values of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are outliers.
- **Potential Issues:** Passengers with unusually large families.
- **Recommendations:** Investigate passengers with Parch > 0. Consider feature engineering to group smaller families together.

### 7. Fare
- **Method:** Range and IQR check.
- **Anomalies:**
    - **Extreme Values:** The fare ranges from 0.00 to 512.33.
    - **Outliers (IQR):** With Q1 ≈ 8, Q3 ≈ 31, IQR ≈ 23, outliers are above 31 + 1.5 * 23 = 65.5.
- **Potential Issues:** Data entry errors, premium fares for certain classes, or group fares.
- **Recommendations:** Verify fares above 65.5. Analyze fare distribution by passenger class. Consider logarithmic transformation to reduce skewness.

| Age         | Extreme Values, IQR   | High                | Values > 65                                     | Verify, cap, or trim extreme ages. Impute missing values.                                                   |
| SibSp       | IQR                   | Moderate            | Values > 2.5 (3, 4, 5, 8)                       | Investigate large families. Consider feature engineering.                                                    |
| Parch       | IQR                   | High                | Values > 0 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)                       | Investigate large families. Consider feature engineering.                                                    |
| Fare        | Extreme Values, IQR   | High                | Values > 65.5                                    | Verify high fares. Analyze fare distribution by class. Consider logarithmic transformation.                 |

## Visual Representations

Due to the limitations of generating actual plots, here are descriptions of plots that would be helpful:

1.  **Box plots:** For 'Age', 'SibSp', 'Parch', and 'Fare' to visualize outliers.
2.  **Scatter plots:** 'Fare' vs. 'Pclass' to see fare distribution across classes.

## Impact on Further Analysis

-   **Skewness:** Outliers in 'SibSp', 'Parch', and 'Fare' contribute to skewness, potentially affecting linear model performance.
-   **Bias:** Extreme 'Age' and 'Fare' values may bias models if not handled properly.
-   **Data Quality:** Missing 'Age' values need imputation to avoid biased results.

## General Recommendations

1.  **Data Cleaning:** Correct any data entry errors identified.
2.  **Outlier Handling:** Apply appropriate outlier handling techniques (winsorizing, trimming, or transformations).
3.  **Missing Value Imputation:** Impute missing 'Age' values using suitable methods.
4.  **Feature Engineering:** Create new features from 'SibSp' and 'Parch' to represent family size.
5.  **Transformation:** Apply logarithmic transformation to 'Fare' to reduce skewness.
